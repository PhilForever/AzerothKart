# Track pipeline and validation

## Track data v1 (proposed)
```lua
return {
  id = "tinker_speedway",
  version = 1,
  bounds = {width=1200, height=800},
  spawnGrid = {{x=320,y=420,heading=1.2}},
  roadRegions = {...}, -- polygon or tile bitmap, standardized collision geometry
  walls = {...},       -- line segments/polygons
  gates = {...},       -- ordered directional checkpoint segments
  items = {...},
  surfaceZones = {...}, -- asphalt/mud/ice/boost
  visuals = {atlas="...", tiles={...}},
}
```

## Prototype vs production
The starter's `Test Oval` is mathematical ellipse annulus to prove movement and rendering. It is **not** the production track renderer and does not provide competitive lap validation.

The M0 placeholder renderer derives its footprint from the same `Track` center and outer/inner radii used by `isDrivable`. It fills the outer ellipse with 64 horizontal gray bands and masks the island with 32 grass bands. All 96 textures are created once; the centerline is not used as a substitute collision boundary. Physics, spawn and steering remain unchanged.

Bands sample the ellipse at each row's midpoint. At the current dimensions their vertical boundary uncertainty is at most 3.40625 world units outside and 2.625 inside. This is a vertical raster approximation, not an exact vector edge or horizontal-error guarantee. Offline tests compare the actual mock rectangles with analytical road classification away from a 3.5-unit vertical boundary margin, including `(400,440)`, which the old tiles left unpainted despite being drivable. Client layout/scaling/performance acceptance is separate.

## Geometry responsibilities
- Track-local spawn positions, bounds, road/walls, surface grip, collision and recovery points.
- Checkpoint ordering must prevent reversed driving and teleport skipping; segment intersection tests must confirm correct gate direction.
- No automatic lap increment from polar-angle wrap alone in production.
- Track version and deterministic content hash must be transmitted to peers and recorded in ghost/replay metadata.
- Map supports normal and mirrored direction only if gate/spawn orientation defined.

## Content authoring
- Build a simple external Python asset/track validation pipeline producing read-only Lua tables; no external executable is needed by addon users.
- Lint spawn outside collision, gates out of order, isolated road islands, item pickup unreachable, wall intersection, max tiling and texture dimensions.
- Document copyright/ownership of every texture, icon, music/sound asset. Start from plain colored tiles where feasible.

## Initial track sequence
M0 `Test Oval` → M3 `Tinker Speedway` → M7 `Murloc Marsh` → M9 `Frost Gearway` and more based on performance metrics.
